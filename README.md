Here is the link to my final: https://aidkose-n423-final.web.app/

This is a mood/journal tracker. You enter in the mood you are feeling, the date, write the subject of today's journal entry, and then write the entry itself. It is then displayed on mood cards. You have the option to delete them if you want. My (U)pdate part of the assignment was the bookmark. The bookmark would create the class bookmarked in my firebase database. You can check this by going to the inspector menu and hovering over the bookmark icon. As you flip between the two, it hides and unhides, or in this case fills and unfills the bookmark. I am used font awesome for the delete button. I use the useState and useEffect hook. I did not use bootstrap, as I was having a lot of issues with it, and I just find it kind of lacking as far as styling goes, so I know I will lose those five points. It is responsive, has 3 components (form, card, cardList), and fulfills all CRUD parts needed. I hope you enjoy it!

P.S.

I just wanted to introduce myself, as I will actually be one of the teacher's of bootcamp for next year. My name is Aiden. I am a TA for Todd, and he asked me to be a teacher for next year. He will help me get better at javascript and react as to be able to teach better. I look forward to working with you guys!
