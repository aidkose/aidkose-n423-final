This is a mood/journal tracker. You enter in the mood you are feeling, the date, write the subject of today's journal entry, and then write the entry itself. It is then displayed on mood cards. You have the option to delete them if you want. My (U)pdate part of the assignment was the bookmark. The bookmark would create the class bookmarked in my firebase database.
